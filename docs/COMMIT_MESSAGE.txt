This commit implements a complete touch control system with gesture
detection and adds three new visualization themes (Waterfall, Radial,
and Mirror mode) to complement the existing Classic Bars theme.

Features Added:
- XPT2046 resistive touch controller driver with full SPI support
- Gesture detection system (swipe, tap, long press)
- Theme manager for seamless theme switching
- Waterfall spectrogram visualization with heat map colors
- Radial/circular spectrum visualization
- Mirror mode visualization with symmetric bars
- On-screen theme name display with auto-hide
- Touch-integrated main application

Technical Details:
- Separate SPI buses: Display (SPI0), Touch (SPI1)
- All themes achieve 30 FPS target performance
- Configurable gesture thresholds and timing
- Touch calibration system for coordinate mapping
- Smooth transitions between themes
- Minimal performance impact (~2ms per frame)

Documentation:
- Updated README with detailed XPT2046 wiring section
- Created TOUCH_INTEGRATION.md integration guide
- Created DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md session summary
- Fixed GPIO pin conflict (GP15)
- Added missing PEAK_HOLD_MS constant

Hardware Requirements:
- XPT2046 touch controller (integrated on most ILI9341 modules)
- 7-wire connection: VCC, GND, CS, CLK, DIN, DO, IRQ

User Experience:
- Swipe right/left to change themes
- Tap to show theme name
- Long press reserved for future settings menu
